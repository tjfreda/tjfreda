        <p> Boil slightly-salted water in a large pot. Season the chicken with salt and cook in the boiling water, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large platter and allow to cool completely. Shred into small pieces.</p>
       <h2>2</h2>
        <p> Combine shredded chicken, ginger, jalapeno pepper, cucumber, basil, mint, cilantro, lemon grass, and peanuts in a large mixing bowl. Whisk together fish sauce, lime juice sugar, sesame oil, and peanut oil in a small bowl: add to the chicken mixture.</p>
      <h2>3</h2>
        <p>Fill a shallow pan with hot water. Dip the rice paper wrappers in the hot water until soft. Spread the rice paper onto a clean, flat surface. Place 2 leaf of the lettuce into the center of a sheet of rice paper: spreak about 1/3 cup of the chicken mixture onto the lettuce leaf. Roll into a cylinder. Repeat. Cut into halves to serve.</p>
